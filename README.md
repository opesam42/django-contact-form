# Django Form Handling Project

## Introduction
This project is a Django-based web application designed to handle user queries through a form. It features a user-friendly interface for submitting queries, including fields for the user's name, email, query method, and message. The application also incorporates form validation, custom error messages, and a confirmation page that displays the submitted data.

## Key Features
- **Form Handling:** A structured form that allows users to submit queries through a straightforward interface.
- **Validation:** Both server-side and client-side validations are implemented to ensure that the form data is accurate and complete before submission.
- **Custom Error Messages:** Clear and customized error messages provide users with specific feedback when the form is not filled out correctly.
- **Success Page:** After successful form submission, users are redirected to a confirmation page.
- **Responsive Design:** The form is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Challenges Faced
- **Form Validation:** Ensuring that all fields were correctly validated and that custom error messages were displayed appropriately.
- **Radio Buttons Handling:** Managing radio buttons, especially hiding the default blank option, required careful CSS manipulation to maintain a clean UI.
- **Git and GitHub Integration:** Learning to use Git for version control and successfully pushing the project to GitHub with a repository name different from the Django directory name.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Django Form Handling:** Gained a deep understanding of Djangoâ€™s form processing, validation, and data management.
- **Responsive Web Design:** Developed skills in creating responsive forms that adapt to various screen sizes using CSS media queries..
- **Version Control:** Enhanced proficiency with Git, including managing branches, commits, and remote repositories on GitHub.
